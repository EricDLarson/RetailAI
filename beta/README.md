Samples and Examples for Google Recommendations AI

Examples in this directory use the old beta Recommendations API, which will be deprecated eventually:

The Recommendations API has migrated to the Retail API, please see the latest GA docs here:

Also, while the examples here using the [discovery API](https://developers.google.com/discovery/) will continue to work, the Retail Client Libraries are the preferred method:
